Our code is based on Tensorflow's CycleGAN tutorial:
https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/cyclegan

Experiments on the code was conducted using Kaggle's interactive notebook and
TPU that they provided.

Performance of our models are evaluated by submitting the code to Kaggle's competition page for a score (lower is better).
